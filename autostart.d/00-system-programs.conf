# - sway-audio-inhibit
# prevents idle while any source of sound is reproducing.
# can be tested by checking all apps apre corked with: pactl list sink-inputs
# - dbus
# Needed for normal sway functioning. Also needed for wob (optional) - See ~/.local/share/systemd/user/wob.service
# Won't be necessary in the future → See FS#63021
# - wob
# It is not here because it runs as a service
# See ~/.local/share/systemd/user/wob.service

# EXAMPLE → many programs in 1 subprocess [sync] - (Errors won't be logged)
